    <h1><u>DAY-1</u></h1>
    <h2>Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h2>
    1. Both are comparison operators and they return boolean values always. The difference
between both the operators is that “==” is used to compare values whereas “ === “ is
used to compare both value and datatype.
2. var x="2";
var y=2;
3. console.log(x==y); It returns true because it only check values not data types. It is able
to check the values because in == it will do type coercion to change the data type so that
the value can be compared.
4. console.log(x===y); It returns false because you can see that values are same but x is of
String type and y is of Number type. You can find the type of any value by using typeof
operator.
5. So in strict equal comparison operator both value and data types should be same like x=2
and y=2 otherwise it returns false.

<h2>What is the spread operator?</h2>
The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to destructure the non-primitive data types like
arrays and objects to access the elements individually.
Code:
const numbersOne = [1, 2, 3];
const numbersTwo = [4, 5, 6];
const numbersCombined = [...numbersOne, ...numbersTwo];
console.log(numbersCombined)
Output:
[1,2,3,4,5,6]

<h2>What are the differences between var, let and const?</h2>
var is a global scoped means variables created using var keyword will be accessible globally. It
can be redeclared and reinitialized.
var a = 10;
let is a block scoped means variables created using let keyword will be accessible only in that
specific block where it has been declared. It cannot be redeclared but it can be reinitialized.
let a = 20;
const is also block scoped means variables created using const keyword will be accessible only
in that specific block where it has been declared. It cannot be redeclared and cannot be
reinitialized.
const a = 30;

<h2>What is execution context</h2>
Each and every browser is having a JavaScript Engine, example Google is having V8 engine,
Internet Explorer is having Chakra and Mozilla Firefox is having Spider Monkey.
JS engine uses a Call stack and also creates a special environment to handle the execution of
the JavaScript code. This environment is known as the Execution Context.
The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in
its execution.
During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the variables
and functions are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets
executed.
There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:
1. Global Execution Context (GEC)
2. Function Execution Context (FEC)

<h2>What is meant by first class functions</h2>
A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language
are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as
an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a
value to a variable.

<h2>What are closures? Give an example of closure</h2>

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its
surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an
outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a
function is created, at function creation time.

<h2>Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</h2>
These all three methods are used to invoke a function where we are supposed to pass an object
as first argument and at the time of definition we don't have mention this object as a parameter
and we can access the values of object by using this keyword in function definition.
call(): The call() method invokes a function in which first argument will be the object and rest
of the arguments required by function will be provided as an individual arguments.
apply(): The apply() method invokes a function in which first argument will be the object and
rest of the arguments will be passed as an array of elements.
bind: The bind() method returns a new function and this function will be having the reference
of the object passed, now whenever you want to use this returned function in the code you can
use it by passing rest of the arguments.
