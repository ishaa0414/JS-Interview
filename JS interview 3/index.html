    <h2>What is the use of setTimeout</h2>
    The setTimeout() is a method inside the window object, it calls the specified function or
evaluates a JavaScript expression provided as a string after a given time period for only once.
We all have used alarms or reminders several times, this setTimeout() method also has the
same purpose in web applications. We use this to delay some kind of executions.
Syntax: setTimeout(()=>{
//code
}, time);

<h2>What is an event loop and call stack</h2>
A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser)
to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently
being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc. or we can say that it
stores global execution context and function execution context.
The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the
call stack. All the web apis functions like setTimeout, setInterval, fetch calls etc. will not be
directly executed inside the execution context, firstly they will be moved to callback queue and
then the moment call stack gets empty these functions will be pushed to call stack from
callback queue by event loop.

<h2>What are promises and why do we need them?</h2>
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage
when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell
leading to unmanageable code.
Multiple callback functions would create callback hell that leads to unmanageable code. Also it
is not easy for any user to handle multiple callbacks at the same time.
Events were not good at handling asynchronous operations.
Promises are the ideal choice for handling asynchronous operations in the simplest manner.
They can handle multiple asynchronous operations easily and provide better error handling
than callbacks and events.
A Promise is in one of these states:
pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
Benefits of Promises
1. Improves Code Readability
2. Better handling of asynchronous operations
3. Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic
4. Better Error Handling

<h2>What is the purpose of async/await keywords?</h2>
An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is
permitted within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based
behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need promise chains.
The use of await pauses the async function until the promise returns a result (resolve or reject)
value.

<h2>What is hoisting?</h2>
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the
top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations,
not initialisation. Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting. Let and const keywords are
not hoisted so when you try to access them before initialization they start giving you Reference
error

<h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the
structure and content of a document on the web.
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It
represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can
interact with the page.

<h2>Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h2>
Undefined
undefined is a global variable that JavaScript creates at run time. JavaScript assigns undefined
to any variable that has been declared but not initialized. In other words, in a case where no
value has been explicitly assigned to the variable, JavaScript calls it undefined.
null
It is one of JavaScript’s primitive data type and is treated as falsy for boolean operations.null is
an empty or non-existent value and null must be assigned. We use null when we want to
explicitly declare that a variable is empty.
not defined
A not defined is a variable that is not declared inside the code at a given point of time with
declaration keyword like var, let, or const.
